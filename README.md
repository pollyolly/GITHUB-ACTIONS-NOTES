## Github Actions Notes

### Setup Branch Protection
Prevent directly pushing commits on main branch, instead they will pull request.
```
Git Repository->Settings->Branch
                Branch Name Pattern = main
                Pull Request before merging
                          -> Require approvals = check 
                Require Status Check to pass before merging
                          -> Require branches to be up to date before mergin = check
```
Create Workflow 
```
$cd my_repository or $git clone <remote repository>
$mkdir .github
$
```
